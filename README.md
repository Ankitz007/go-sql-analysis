# SQL Client Comparison: GORM vs SQLx

## Overview

In my journey to find the best SQL client for Go, I decided to test out two of the most popular libraries: [GORM](https://gorm.io/) and [SQLx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx). Both libraries offer distinct advantages and are widely used in the Go community. I wrote this code to evaluate their performance and usability in a practical scenario.

This project showcases how to use both GORM and SQLx to interact with a SQL database, and highlights their features, ease of use, and other key aspects.

Certainly! Hereâ€™s the revised `Usage` section with the requested note:

---

## Usage

1. **Configure Upstream API**:
   - Open `utils/constants.go` and update the upstream API settings.

2. **Configure Database IP**:
   - **GORM**: Update the database IP in `mygorm.go`.
   - **SQLx**: Update the database IP in `mysqlx.go`.

After configuring the necessary details, you can run the examples from the `main.go` file.

## Features

- **GORM**:
  - **ORM Capabilities**: GORM provides an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) interface, which simplifies database interactions by allowing you to work with Go structs rather than raw SQL.
  - **Automatic Migrations**: GORM can automatically handle schema migrations based on your struct definitions.
  - **Associations**: Easily manage relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
  - **Built-in Hooks**: Support for hooks to customize the lifecycle of model operations.

- **SQLx**:
  - **Extensible SQL Queries**: SQLx extends the standard `database/sql` package, offering a more flexible and powerful way to execute queries and map results.
  - **Named Queries**: Support for named query parameters, which can improve readability and maintainability.
  - **Scan into Structs**: Directly scan query results into structs or slices, providing more control over the data handling process.
  - **Flexibility**: Minimal abstraction over SQL, giving you more control over your queries and schema.


## Comparison

- **Ease of Use**: GORM's ORM approach simplifies interactions with the database, whereas SQLx provides more granular control but requires more boilerplate code.
- **Performance**: SQLx might offer better performance in scenarios requiring complex queries due to its minimal abstraction.
- **Flexibility**: SQLx offers greater flexibility for custom queries, while GORM provides a higher-level abstraction.
